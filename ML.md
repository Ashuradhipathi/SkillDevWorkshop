Supervised learning 
- Regression : predicting numerical values
- classification : predict categorical values

Unsupervised learning:
- Clustering : grouping of data 
- Association : find frequent co-occurences
- Link prediction : discover relationships in data
- Data reduction : project features to fewer features


Reinforcement learning


In machine learning  ,
In regression, the following are the different techniques - Ridge regresion, SVM, Random forest, Neural networks
In classification, Naive Bayes, SVM, NN
In clustering: K-means, Hierarchical clustering
