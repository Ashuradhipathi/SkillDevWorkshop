Supervised learning 
- Regression : predicting numerical values
- classification : predict categorical values

Unsupervised learning:
- Clustering : grouping of data 
- Association : find frequent co-occurences
- Link prediction : discover relationships in data
- Data reduction : project features to fewer features


Reinforcement learning


In machine learning  ,
In regression, the following are the different techniques - Ridge regresion, SVM, Random forest, Neural networks
<br>
In classification, Naive Bayes, SVM, NN
<br>
In clustering: K-means, Hierarchical clustering
<br>

## Issues 
- There will be a huge data loss while performing iterations
- Unclassification of noisy data
- inoccurence of preprocessing models
-  Irregularties in the gain measures
-  Not choosing the right model
-  not having enough data, low qulaitty of data
-  Hiring the wrong people
-  working on /with wrong tools

-  While working on machine learning algorithms, we use following libraries

-  scikit-learn

- pytorch
- keras
- tensorflow

- OpenCV

## SAupervising methodology
- select model
- Train(determine parameters)
- Test model
- Move model to production
