- Regression : predicting numerical values
- classification : predict categorical values

Unsupervised learning:
- Clustering : grouping of data 
- Association : find frequent co-occurences
- Link prediction : discover relationships in data
- Data reduction : project features to fewer features


Reinforcement learning:
