AI is defined as area of learning/performing the task commonly associated with intelliegnce such as discovering, generalizing, ability to reason or learn from past experiences 
divided into 
- ML
- NLP
-Expert systems
- computer vision
- planning
- robotics
- data visualization
 
Machine learning is defined as an application of AI that provides a system the ability to learn, interpret and improve from the experiences without explicitly programmed is known as machine learning.
ML focuses on developmnet of computer programs that can access the data and use the data for learning.
ML algorithms are divided into folllowing:
- classification : predicting the categories
- regression : predicst values
- clustering : discovering the structure
- anomaly detection : finding the specific data points
- two way or multi way classification : predicting the two way or multiple categories or patterns

AI is the broad concept of machines that perform the task in a away similar to a human, AI is classified into one or multiple fundamental groups common to system design or autonomous vehicles.
ML is the current application of AI that would surround around the idea of machne saccessing the data and learning themselves. In general AI are sytems which run or handle the taksk.
A new subset of machine learning called deep learning uses neural networks and algorithms to process the data in an effort to train these neural networks for sepcific intent.
