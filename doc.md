## Import Statements

**Standard Libraries:**

* `typing`: Used for type hints to improve code readability.
* `uuid`: Provides functions for generating unique identifiers.

**Specific Libraries:**

* `langchain`: Offers functionalities for text-based AI tasks.
* `tqdm`: Enables progress bars for monitoring operations.
* `upstash_vector`: Manages vector-based search using Upstash.
* `langchain_google_genai`: Facilitates interaction with Google AI models.
* `streamlit`: Creates web-based user interfaces for interacting with the system.
* `os`: Provides access to environment variables.
* `exa_py`: Enables interaction with the Exa search engine.
* `google.generativeai.types.safety_types`: Defines safety settings for Google AI models.


## Functions

**1. retrieve_context(query):**

This function utilizes the Exa search engine to find relevant text snippets based on a given query. It returns a list containing the retrieved text contexts.

**2. UpstashVectorStore(index, embeddings):**

This class is designed to manage a vector store using Upstash. It offers the following methods:

* `delete_vectors(ids, delete_all)`: Deletes specific vectors (identified by IDs) or the entire store based on the `delete_all` parameter.
* `add_documents(documents, ids, batch_size)`: Adds documents to the vector store. This involves generating embeddings for the documents and indexing them for efficient retrieval. The `batch_size` parameter controls the number of documents processed at once.
* `similarity_search_with_score(query, k)`: Performs a similarity search based on a query and returns a list of `k` most similar documents along with their scores.

**3. get_context(query, vector_store):**

This function retrieves relevant context for a specific query by leveraging the vector store.

**4. get_prompt(question, context):**

This function constructs a prompt suitable for a large language model by combining the provided question and context.

## Environment Variables

* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Essential for using Google AI models.
* `Exa`: An API key for accessing the Exa search engine.
* `UPSTASH_TOKEN`: A token used for connecting to the Upstash vector store.

## Main Code

1. **Initialization:**
    * A language model instance (`llm`) is created using Google's Gemini-Pro model.
    * The Upstash vector store connection is established.
    * An instance of `UpstashVectorStore` is created to manage vector search.

2. **Main Function:**
    * Streamlit is employed to create a chat-like interface for user interaction.
    * The user is prompted to enter a query.
    * Relevant context is retrieved from Exa based on the user's query.
    * The retrieved context is added to the vector store.
    * Additional context is fetched from the vector store using similarity search.
    * A prompt for the large language model is constructed by combining the question and context.
    * The prompt is sent to the language model.
    * The generated response from the model is displayed to the user.
